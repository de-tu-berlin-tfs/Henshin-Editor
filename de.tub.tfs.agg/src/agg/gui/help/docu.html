&nbsp; A brief Description of &nbsp;AGG</TT> 
</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><TT>Abstract</TT></H3>

<em>AGG</em> is a <b>rule based visual language</b> supporting an algebraic 
approach to graph transformation. It aims at the specification and prototypical 
implementation of applications with complex graph-structured data. 
<em>AGG</em> code may be used</A> (implicit in "code") 
as a general purpose graph transformation engine in high-level JAVA applications 
employing graph transformation methods. Due to its rule based character <em>AGG</em> may 
also be near in the field of artificial intelligence; 
(we are looking for further evidence in that case).

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
<TT>Characteristic of AGG is: </TT>

specified by graph rules using an if-then description style.
</TD></TR> 
<TR><TD>

rules with negative application conditions to express requirements for 
non-existence of substructures.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>

<P>

It is possible to define typed attributed graph 
transformation with <b><em> node type inheritance</em></b>. 
This means that the attributed
type graph can be enriched with an inheritance relation between nodes.
Each node type can have more then one direct ancestor from which it
 inherits the attributes and edges.<br>
In this context, it is possible to define <b><em>abstract rules</em></b>, containing
ancestor (parents) nodes. These rules are equivalent to a number of <em>concrete</em> rules,
resulting from the substitution of the ancestor nodes by the nodes in their
inheritance clan. Therefore, rules become more compact and suitable for
their use in combination with meta-modelling.<br>
<P>
The tool environment provides graphical <b>editors</b> for graphs and rules
and an integrated textual editor for Java expressions. 
Moreover, visual <b>interpretation</b> is supported.
While step means performing direct derivations (transformation)
for user-selected productions (rules) and occurrences (matches), 
a whole transformation sequence is executed in the interpretation mode. 
Furtheron, analysis tools for graph transformation
systems are available.

<H3><TT>Language Concepts</TT></H3>

<b><em>AGG</em> programs</b> consist of two main parts:
a <b>graph grammar</b> attributed by Java objects
which may come from user-defined Java classes. This set of classes forms 
the second part. Clearly, libraries of Java classes such as JDK are available, but are not considered to be part of an <em>AGG</em> program.
Graph grammars contain a start graph and a set of rules 
which may have negative application conditions.
The way graph rules are applied directly realizes the single-pushout approach 
to graph transformation. The attribution of nodes and arcs by Java objects an 
expressions essentially follows the ideas of attributed graph grammars,  
where Java classes and expressions replace algebraic specifications and terms. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>A graph</b> consists of two disjoint sets containing the <b>nodes</b> and the 
<b>arcs</b> of the graph. As a whole, the nodes and arcs are called the 
objects of the graph. Every arc represents a directed connection between two
nodes, which are called the source and target nodes of the arc.
To allow for some further classification of a graph object, any object
may be associated with exactly one
label from a given label set. The labels are also called <b>types</b> 
and if an object <em>o</em> has the label <em>l</em>, we say <em>o</em> is of
type <em>l</em>. Note that in our notion of a graph, we can have <b>multiple
arcs</b> of the same type between a single pair of nodes, because every arc has
an identity on its own, just like a node does. This distinguishes our
view from another popular notion of graphs where an arc is
described just as a relation between nodes.
Note that in our idea of a graph, the position of a node or an arc in the
plane holds neither syntactic nor semantic information, i.e., the layout
of a graph is just a matter of presentation for the sake of
readability to the user. 
<P>
<b>An attribute</b> in <em>AGG</em> is declared just like a variable in a conventional 
programming language: we specify a <b>name</b> and a certain <b>type</b> 
for the attribute, and then we may assign any <b>value</b> of the specified
type to it. Of course, there can be multiple attributes for one object, 
even of the same type. 
Note that all graph objects of the same type also share
their attribute declarations, i.e. the list of attribute types and
selectors; only the values of the attributes may be chosen individually.
From a conceptual point of view, attribute declarations
have to be considered as an integral part of the definition of a type.
This observation is not very surprising, since
in many respects, the concept of a type with integral attribute
declarations resembles the notion of a class with its member
variables in object-oriented programming.
<P>
<b>An action</b> can be viewed as a state transition, and
obviously, a transition of states can be specified by giving descriptions
of the states before an after the action in question. Since states
are modeled as graphs in <em>AGG</em>, it follows that basically an action can be
described as a <b>pair of two graphs</b> modeling the ``before'' and ``after''
states. In the ``before'' state of an operation, we collect all the 
preconditions that have to be met for the operation to take place.
The left-hand side of a graph rule states the necessary
conditions for the specified operation to take place: A rule can only be
applied if its conditions are fulfilled by the current concrete state
graph. Quite obviously, this corresponds conceptually to an <em>if-then</em>
clause with an empty <em>else</em> branch in a textual programming language.
The checking of the conditions is accomplished by trying to find a
match for the graph pattern given by the rule's left-hand side in
the state graph, which is also called the <b>host graph</b>
for the rule application. In terms of theory, matches and rules are 
<b>graph-homomorphisms</b>, i.e. mappings of the objects of one graph to those 
of another with certain compatibility commitments concerning source and target
mappings. To indicate which objects are mapped to one another in the figures, 
we use numerical tags preceding an object's type name, separated by a colon.
<P>
The effect of a <b>rule application</b> at a given match is a state 
<b>graph transformation</b>, also called <b>derivation</b> or
graph transformation <b>step</b>. Besides manipulating the nodes 
and arcs of a graph, a graph rule may also perform computations 
on the object attributes. Please note that <em>AGG</em> is not limited to injective 
morphisms. Any rule or match morphism may map two or more different objects 
to one single image object. By using non-injective rule-morphisms,
 for example, 
it is easy to declare a rule merging multiple nodes into one, contracting 
all the in- and outgoing arcs of the merged nodes at the single resulting node.
The <b>formal semantics</b> of rule application is given in terms of 
<b>category theory</b>, by a single categorical construction known as 
a <b>pushout</b> in an appropriate category of attributed graphs with 
partial morphisms - hence the name <b>Single-Pushout (SPO) approach</b>.
<P>
We have already seen that the left-hand side of a rule states the necessary
conditions that the current state must fulfill so that the rule can be
applied. Therefore, we may also call them <b>application
conditions</b>.
Quite frequently though, the need arises to
express that something must <b>not</b> be the case for a rule to be
applicable.
With a <b>negative application condition (NAC)</b> you specify exactly 
that fraction of a matching situation that you don't want to happen.

<b>Colimit Techniques:</b>
    For the treatment of structuring mechanisms for categorical constructions,
    there is one most important concept in category theory: the colimit construction. 
    In applications related to computer science, the colimit separates elements in 
    different components and identifies elements which are connected via their relations. 
    The colimit construction is not only relevant for scheme transformation. Recently,
    current oject oriented modeling methods like the UML, integrate structural and 
    behavioural aspects with extensions of state machine formalisms. Category theory 
    and especially the colimit construction, is suitable for both aspects, providing 
    a unifying formal framework for object oriented design. Other application areas 
    are Structuring and Refinement of formal specifications based on colimits in the 
    category of signatures, Operational Semantics of functional logic programming 
    languages based on the category of jungles, and Algebraic Development Techniques 
    and their extensions (e.g. Statecharts, Graph Grammars, Algebraic High-Level 
    Petri Nets, Action Nets or Dynamic Abstract Data Types). These applications 
    can be based on colimit computation in two categories, namely signatures and 
    graph signatures. Some main results are:
    A new constructive proof of co-completeness 
    for sets, signatures and graph structures 
    with partial morphisms.
    Proofs establishing (almost) linear complexity of the colimit constructions 
    in all these categories. 
    A library for colimit computations in these categories 
    implemented in Eiffel, Java and C++.
    The algorithms are directly derived from the 
    constructed proofs mentioned above. Additionally, the application of the colimit 
    library in different a reas both in the context of specitfication languages and graph
    transformation is outlined. Performance tests and comparisons on several different 
    development platforms establish the practical applicability of the colimit library.

<b>Efficient Graph Pattern Matching:</b>
The <em>AGG</em> system represents -and solves- the problem of graph matching,
a.k.a. subgraph homomorphism problem, as a constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP). By de-coupling the solution algorithm from the graph
model, this approach allows for variations of the employed graph model
without affecting the CSP solution algorithm.
