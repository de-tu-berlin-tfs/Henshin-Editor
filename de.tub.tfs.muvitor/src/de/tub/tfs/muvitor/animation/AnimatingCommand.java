/**
 * This is the main class users have to use in this GEF animation package. It
 * implements a {@link Command} that can be given information about how some
 * model elements (EMF {@link EObject}s) should be animated that are visualized
 * as {@link IFigure}s in {@link GraphicalViewer} s. For this, you specify
 * stepwise absolute ({@link Point}s) or relative (model elements) locations and
 * optional size factors for the model elements to be animated as described
 * below in detail.
 * <hr/>
 * 
 * <h3>Why not use GEF's animation mechanism?</h3>
 * <p>
 * The GEF already contains the classes {@link Animation} and {@link Animator}
 * that can be used to animate figures. The main advantage of using this package
 * is that you can specify more powerful animations more flexibly. More
 * precisely, in addition to GEF you get this:
 * <ul>
 * <li>You can specify <b>which model</b> to animate instead of the model's
 * figure, which will be determined automatically at animation runtime. This
 * means that you can specify animations independently from actual viewers.</li>
 * <li>The stepwise definition allows you to <b>animate several elements
 * independently</b> along complex paths with flexible timing/speed (by
 * interpolating intermediate steps).</li>
 * <li>Each animated figure can be <b>zoomed smoothly on its path</b> according
 * to absolute size factors. Each figure resizes independently of all other
 * (possibly animated) figures in the same viewer!</li>
 * <li>You can easily specify <b>parallel animations</b> in several viewers.</li>
 * <li>AnimatingCommand will automatically take care of <b>reversing animations
 * for undo operations</b>.</li>
 * <li>With {@link AnimationPathModifier}s you have a convenient way to <b>alter
 * the animation paths</b> to nice curves.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <hr/>
 * 
 * <h3>Stepwise animation definition - an example</h3>
 * To understand the principle of stepwise animation definition, we discuss the
 * example time schedule matrix below. It represents the definition of an
 * animation of three arbitrary model elements (<i>element1-3</i>). We have a
 * column for each element to be animated and a row for each defined animation
 * step, each with a positive integer value <i>d1-3</i> representing the
 * duration of this step in msecs (except for the first, which is the starting
 * position row):
 * <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1">
 * <tr>
 * <td></td>
 * <td><b>element1</b></td>
 * <td><b>element2</b></td>
 * <td><b>element3</b></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><b>start</b></td>
 * <td>element1</td>
 * <td>Point(0,0)</td>
 * <td>-/-</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>d1</td>
 * <td>element2</td>
 * <td>-/-</td>
 * <td>element1</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>d2</td>
 * <td>element3</td>
 * <td>-/-</td>
 * <td>element2</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>d3</td>
 * <td>element1</td>
 * <td>Point(100,100)</td>
 * <td>-/-</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * First, you have to understand what the performed animation will look like.
 * After that you shall see how you can define this animation by calling the
 * appropriate methods.
 * <p>
 * In short, each table entry tells when (after the sum of durations till this
 * step) the figure of the column's element has to be where (absolute or
 * relative location). For example, element1 is supposed to start at its own
 * position, to move in d1 msecs to the position of element2, after that to move
 * in d2 msecs to the position of element3, and to return in d3 seconds back to
 * its initial position.<br>
 * Note that when specifying relative locations, they will be resolved to the
 * absolute locations that the related figure has <i>before the animation</i>!
 * Thus, element1's figure will move to the locations of the figures of element2
 * and element3 that they have before the animation, even if these will be
 * animated themselves in this particular animation. <br>
 * Of course, only those elements will be animated, for which a figure (being
 * related to this element by some {@link GraphicalEditPart}) can be found.
 * There is no need for element1-3 having figures in <i>the same</i> viewer at
 * command-execution nor command-definition time, but only figures in open
 * viewers that exist at execution-time will be animated. AnimatingCommand will
 * not regard it as an error if no figure can be found for an element at all!
 * <p>
 * Let's continue with element2 to understand step interpolation: As you can see
 * in the table, only an absolute starting position and a position after the
 * third step has been specified. Generally, undefined steps between defined
 * steps will be interpolated linearly. So, after d1 msecs element2's figure
 * would reach the point (33,33), after d1+d2 msecs (66,66), and finally
 * (100,100).<br>
 * Note that an animation of a particular figure always starts at the first
 * specified step and ends at the last specified step. Furthermore, this could
 * lead to unexpected behavior if you specify a relative location by some other
 * model element for which no figure location can be resolved! If no start or
 * end location for the whole path of a model's figure can be resolved or
 * interpolated, it will not be animated at all, but also no error message will
 * be raised.
 * <p>
 * How element3's figure would be animated should be obvious by now. So let's
 * see how we can specify this animation in some editor action. Suppose we have
 * a container model element <code>parent</code>, which is the contents of the
 * viewer that we expect to show, and we want to animate the figures for
 * element1-3. <b>This viewer must implement {@link IGraphicalViewerProvider}
 * (have a look there for an example) to be found by AnimatingCommand.</b> In
 * addition we may have a {@link CompoundCommand} that manipulates our model
 * before and possibly after the animation. The following shows the right code
 * for this scenario (we will discuss another possibility for special purposes
 * after that as well):<br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * AnimatingCommand aniComm = new AnimatingCommand();
 * // initialize objects for animation
 * aniComm.initializeAnimatedElement(element1, parent, null);
 * aniComm.initializeAnimatedElement(element2, parent, null);
 * // specify starting position
 * aniComm.specifyStep(element1, element1);
 * aniComm.specifyStep(element2, new Point(0, 0));
 * // finish &quot;starting step&quot; definition, declare step with duration d1
 * aniComm.nextStep(d1);
 * // specify step 1
 * aniComm.specifyStep(element1, element2);
 * aniComm.initializeAnimatedElement(element3, parent, null);
 * aniComm.specifyStep(element3, element1);
 * // finish definition of step 1, declare step with duration d2
 * aniComm.nextStep(d2);
 * // specify step 2
 * aniComm.specifyStep(element1, element3);
 * aniComm.specifyStep(element3, element2);
 * // finish definition of step 2, declare step with duration d3
 * aniComm.nextStep(d3);
 * // specify step 3
 * aniComm.specifyStep(element1, element1);
 * aniComm.specifyStep(element2, new Point(100, 100));
 * // queue the animating command in the compound command
 * compoundCommand.add(aniComm);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * In this short code snippet, we first create a plain AnimatingCommand and
 * declare element1 and element2 as to be animated in the viewer that has
 * <code>parent</code> as contents. This must be done for an element before
 * specifying any steps for it. We could have set some
 * {@link AnimationPathModifier}s instead of the last <code>null</code>
 * argument, but this is not mandatory.<br>
 * Now, look at the matrix table above again: In the first step (which you have
 * to imagine always as happening with the duration 0msec) we specify element1's
 * and element2's figures to be at the location of the figure of element1 itself
 * and at Point(0,0), respectively.<br>
 * Note that we have not initialized element3 so far. We could have done so,
 * though. It is not important in which step you initialize an element, as this
 * does not change the animation at all, because AnimatingCommand will fill the
 * specification for this element up to the current step with place holders. It
 * is important that you must do this <i>sometime before</i> you call
 * <code>specifyStep(...)</code> for this element!<br>
 * With this we have completed the specification of the first step and can
 * proceed to the next step by calling <code>nextStep(d1)</code>, which states
 * that the next step should take <code>d1</code> msecs to complete.<br>
 * The next row in the table says that in this step element1's figure should
 * move to the original position of element2's figure, and that element3's
 * figure should start its animation at the original position of element1's
 * figure. For this we have to initialize element3 belatedly. <br>
 * It should be clear by now, how the remaining lines correspond to the table
 * entries. Note, that you do not have to finish the last step by calling
 * <code>nextStep</code> a fourth time, however you would not know what duration
 * to specify for this unused step. <br>
 * By adding the AnimatingCommand to the compound command we are done!
 * 
 * <h3>Composite figures as targets</h3>
 * You should be aware that in fact not the figure of the target edit part is
 * used to resolve the target location of an animation step, but the content
 * pane of the target edit part is. <br>
 * By default, an edit part returns its figure when asked for its content pane;
 * so for simple figures or if you just want the center of the whole composite
 * figure to be the target location, you do not have to worry about this. <br>
 * But you can make use of this by overriding your
 * {@link GraphicalEditPart#getContentPane()} to return a subfigure of your edit
 * part's (composite) figure. So, you can let the center of the subfigure be the
 * target location of each animation step that is specified with this edit part
 * as target!
 * 
 * 
 * If you have edit parts that are represented as composite figures
 * 
 * <h3>Animations that resize figures on their path</h3>
 * Optionally, you may specify a size factor for each step with
 * {@link #specifyStep(Object, Object, double)} to highlight some element. The
 * size factor is absolute, a value of 1 will set the animated figure to the
 * original size (as does the convenience method
 * {@link #specifyStep(Object, Object)}). A value of -1 will mark this element's
 * size factor as to be interpolated for the current step, similar to the
 * locations.
 * 
 * <h3>Modifying the path of an animated figure</h3>
 * If the figures' movement along a straight line bores you, you may choose from
 * several alternative movements. For this you can call
 * {@link #initializeAnimatedElement(Object, Object, AnimationPathModifier)}
 * with one of the predefined {@link AnimationPathModifier}s that are accessible
 * by static getters. Have a look there for the different available modifiers.
 * 
 * <h3>Switch animations globally</h3>
 * Sometimes you might just want to switch off all animations caused by
 * AnimatingCommands. For this you just have to call
 * {@link #setPerformAnimation(boolean)}. This packages provides a sample
 * {@link ToggleAnimationAction}, which can be provided as a button in the
 * editor's tool bar that switches this flag.
 * 
 * <h3>Visualize the paths of animated elements (for debugging)</h3>
 * With {@link #setDebug(boolean)} you can set a flag that forces the figures to
 * mark their way as a red line, which will remain visible in the viewer after
 * animation. So after the animation has been performed you can see and examine
 * the paths of the figures.
 * 
 * <h3>Initializing at execution time rather at definition time</h3>
 * A remark about an slightly different way to define animations (i.e. by
 * subclassing): AnimatingCommand features an empty method {@link #initialize()}
 * , which will be called in {@link #execute()} and {@link #undo()} before doing
 * anything else. With this, you may implement own AnimatingCommands and include
 * the element initializations and step definitions in this subclasses by
 * putting them in the overridden {@link #initialize()}. <br>
 * The main purpose of this approach is to perform initialization at execution
 * time rather than command-creation time! For example, consider you have a list
 * of elements you want to animate, e.g. all nodes being shown in a viewer (like
 * in {@link AnimatingCommand}), and you initialize them dynamically in a loop.
 * Now imagine you want to create a complex action with several model changes,
 * including creation and deletion of nodes, and moving around all nodes. The
 * only way to initialize elements that are newly created in the surrounding
 * compound command, is to subclass AnimatingCommand and to put the initializing
 * loop in {@link #initialize()} so that all elements in the list are
 * initialized <i>just before the animation is executed</i> when the compound
 * command already created the new nodes, rather than when the compound command
 * and the AnimatingCommand are being created and no model change has happened
 * yet. Have a look at AnimatingDemoAction1 for an example.
 * 
 * <h3>Refreshing viewers between animation series</h3>
 * A word about refreshing the animated viewers: Depending on what you want to
 * animate you may need to explicitly let the animated viewers be flushed before
 * or after the animation. To achieve this you can experiment with setting the
 * flags{@link #flushBefore} and {@link #flushAfter}. This could be needed
 * especially in consecutive animations, though, I can not figure out a general
 * rule for all scenarios.
